### The Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is taking over control over some HTML code with Vue.js and practicing with data binding, interpolation, v-bind, event binding with v-on, output lists of data with v-for, conditional content with v-if and v-else.

### About the Project
This is my first VUE.js project as a part of the projects of the bestselling course “UDEMY - Vue - The Complete Guide (w/ Router, Vuex, Composition API)”. 
This project is called “monster slayer game” that I dived deep into Vue JS. 
There are various options for fighting against a monster, there is a battle log where we can see what happened. 

We start creating a Vue app by calling Vue.app() and we store it as a constant, then we mount that app to the div element with an "id" name. Data is core concept of Vue apps that we can thinks them as a variables in the regular JavaScript. In this game we manage some data like player's health and monster's health. We need data this data option in our Vue app configuration object and we return the object that holds our data. 

Another important feature in Vue app is methods, for example when we click "attack" button, we trigger a method that reduces the monster health.
